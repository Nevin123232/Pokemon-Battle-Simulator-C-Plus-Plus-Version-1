This is the prequel to my pokemon battle simulator in java. 


In this simulator, there are 13 pokemon. Two individuals can choose one pokemon each and they battle each other to see who will win. This game is able to function in english and in french. The pokemon able to be used in this simulator are:

- charizard
- garchomp
- greninja
- lucario
- mewtwo
- mimikyu
- roserade
- snorlax
- togekiss
- tyranitar
- volcorona
- weavile
- zeraora

These are the pokemon in this simulator. The program is created in c++ and the code and executable files can be found in this repository.

Have fun with it!
